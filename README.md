# [WIPRO Sustainability Challenge](https://machinehack.com/hackathon/wipro_sustainability_machine_learning_challenge/overview)

 The world is waking up to the deleterious effect of fossil fuels on our environment. As the doomsday clock ticks away, human beings are turning to renewable energy to avert a possible apocalypse. Fortunately, the sun is a well-spring of clean energy. Taking the cue, Wipro, in association with MachineHack, has designed a forecasting challenge to optimise solar power generation using ML models.

## Problem Statement

A solar power generation company wants to optimize solar power production and needs the prediction model to predict the Clearsky Global Horizontal Irradiance(GHI).

**The evaluation metric used is the Mean Squared Error**

## Dataset

The dataset used is the [WIPRO Sustainability Dataset](https://machinehack.com/hackathon/wipro_sustainability_machine_learning_challenge/data) from MachineHack. The task is time-series forecasting of the Clearsky Global Horizontal Irradiance(GHI) values over a period of ten years with a timestep of 30 minutes. 


**Target Variable: ClearSky DHI, CLearSky DNI, CLearSky GHI**

## Model(s) Used

This needs to be a description of the model used and a brief overview of how it works in theory 

## Future Work
Good ideas or strategies that you were not able to implement which you think can help  improve performance.
